## Introduction

This Repository is Designed to help you learn Docker by providing Practical examples of Dockerizing different types of applications. Each Project folder contains the necessary Docker Configuration files and a step-by-step guide to help you Understand the Process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShivankK26/Docker-Learnings.git
    ```

2. Follow the instructions in each project folder to learn how to Dockerize the specific application.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `hello-docker/`: Contains the Source Code and Docker configuration for a JavaScript application.
-`mern-docker/`: Contains the Source Code and Docker Configuration for a MERN application.
- `next-docker/`: Contains the Source Code and Docker Configuration for a Next.js application.
- `react-docker/`: Contains the Source Code and Docker Configuration for a React application.
- `vite-project/`: Contains the Source Code and Docker Configuration for a Vite Project.

## Dockerizing Applications

### JavaScript Application

The `hello-docker` directory contains a JavaScript application. Follow the steps below to dockerize it:

1. Navigate to the `hello-docker` directory:
    ```bash
    cd hello-docker
    ```

### MERN Application

The `mern-docker` directory contains a full-stack MERN application. Follow the steps below to dockerize it:

1. Navigate to the `mern-docker` directory:
    ```bash
    cd mern-docker
    ```

### React Application

The `react-docker` directory contains a React application. Follow the steps below to dockerize it:

1. Navigate to the `react-docker` directory:
    ```bash
    cd react-docker
    ```

### Vite Application

The `vite-project` directory contains a Vite application. Follow the steps below to dockerize it:

1. Navigate to the `vite-project` directory:
    ```bash
    cd vite-project
    ```

### Next.js Application

The `next-docker` directory contains a Next.js application. Follow the steps below to dockerize it:

1. Navigate to the `next-docker` directory:
    ```bash
    cd next-docker
    ```
